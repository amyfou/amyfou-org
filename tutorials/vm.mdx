# Spin up a virtual machine!

What if you don't have the hardware necessary to work on a coding problem?  
One alternative is to create a 'virtual machine' using a cloud service such as
MS Azure (under the University's license), the University's [High Performance Computing Cluster](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Compute+Resources) or a pay-as-you-go cloud service
such as [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/), [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) or similar.

## Advantages and disadvantages

Spinning up a virtual machine (vm) allows you to easily select an operating system and provision
the memory, ram and compute power you want or need for your project.  It also provides you with
server admin and backups through your cloud provider.  While you're a University of Arizona student,
you have access to Microsoft Azure services and to a High Performance Computing Cluster, so that
you can create a vm at no additional cost to you.  These services are paid for by your tuition and fees.

But this is by no means an all-purpose good idea.  When you create a virtual machine in a cloud service, you have even less privacy
than you do on your own computer.  The work you do can be lost if the service unexpectedly
stops, or you can be priced out if and when the provider changes their pricing or 
conditions of use.  Further, if you're not able to use a university-sponsored account, these services
charge monthly or by the minute/hour of use, and in the long run this can get expensive.

Virtual machines are good for creating a computing environment you can use for a
specific set of projects, projects that you are consistently backing up (i.e. via github or similar), and
that you do not need to maintain for a long period of time.

## For the COLRC-V2 team

Amy has created a vm (informally known as 'Hopper') in the Microsoft Azure service.
Students on the team can request an account on Hopper.  If you do, you would:

1. contact Amy to get account credentials and set up your ssh key authentication; then
2. let Amy know when you want to begin your work session (the machine must be started before you 
connect, and stopped when you're done, as Azure counts minutes of use and eventually we'll run
out of university-sponsored time)
3. agree to follow a set of protocols to ensure that your work can be saved separately
from the work done by other students on the machine, and to always close out your sessions
fully when you're done.
4. use the `working remotely via terminal` tutorial to learn how to work on a remote machine.

## For any purpose you'd like

You can spin up your own VM any time by accessing the [MS Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/azure-portal) and signing
in with your UA NetID and password.  From there, you can go to services > virtual machines.

Follow the prompts to select the resources you want or need, and create your machine!

Don't worry about making mistakes - these machines can be removed quite easily, and the setup
process does not take long.

Once your machine actually builds, you'll see a URL that you can use to ssh into the terminal. Your NetID
will be your username, and your user account will have sudo access.  You can then follow the
`working remotely via terminal` tutorial to use the machine.

Each time you're done working in your vm, you'll exit it and then stop the machine
from your MS Azure portal.  The next time you'd like to work, you'll start the
machine from the portal.

## Your macine, for the COLRC-v2

If you create a machine for our project, here are the specs Amy used, I know these work.

- Debian 11
- Standard D2s v3 (2 vcpus, 8 GiB memory)

Additionally, our development app requires its own network.

- On the Networking tab, you need to set up inbound and outbound port rules
to allow traffic to and from ports 3000, 4000, 8080, and 80.

Once you've spun up your machine, you'll need to install git and docker.  You'll probably already have
python3, but you'll need pip3 as well.  Once that's done, clone 
the repo. Then set up the development environment as you would on your own machine, following the
instructions in the readme In the frontend code, look for App.js at the root.  There are two
`clients` configured after the import statements.  Each client needs a uri.

Replace the uri stem (i.e. localhost) with the URL of your vm.  Keep the ports (:8080 and :4000).

Then build and up as usual.

Once the system is up, go to your 8080/console in a browser.  Go to the `tables` view.
On each of these three tables:  `audiofiles`, `textfiles`, `elicitationfiles`, under `modify`, you'll
find a computed field.  Edit the computed field - which is an SQL statement that
tells the machine where it can find our pdf, png, wav and mp3 files.  

In the SQL statement is a URL path.  Change the stem of that path to your machine URL:80.  

Execute the SQL.

At this point, your development environment should be working!  You do not have to down/up
the machine after this step, it'll persist at least until you do a new gitpull that includes
a modified database.

Then, have fun!

## Using the HPC Cluster

This should be possible, but requies some additional research.  Folks with HPC
accounts (= faculty like Amy, and others who Amy adds to her group) can spin up
a vm to run a dockerized application like ours, but we have to first configure 
it in a [singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/user-guide/singularity_and_docker.html) uber
container.

If you'd like to try to do this, let Amy know and she'll set you up with an HPC account!

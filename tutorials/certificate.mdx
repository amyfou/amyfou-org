# Renewing our certificate

The production version of the colrc application runs with `https`, meaning that
all traffic to and from the app is encrypted.  This is a very important, and it
requires that we maintain a certificate verifying that our domain is registered to us 
and the URL we're running at is registered with that domain.

Every so often, that certificate requires renewal.   

For (waves hands in the air) reasons, we have not automated our certificate 
renewal process.  Yet.  Instead, we update the certificate manually.

## Renew the certificate

# what you need 

- root access to the production server
- access to the AWS Dashboard for the domain `thecolrc.org`
- you MUST remember to use the DATABASE PASSWORD when you down the application

# what you do

We use [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) as our certificate generator.

And we store our certificates in a directory that lives on our production server at `/etc/letsencrypt`.  This folder is 
owned by root. ssh into the production server, navigate to the root of `/colrc-v2` and
down the application by running, and using the DATABASE PASSWORD when prompted for a pwd.

```./disaster.sh```  

When the script prompts you for a pwd, use our *database* pwd, not your sudo pwd.  If you enter the wrong
pwd, stop.  You'll need to (a) remove the db_data folder, (b) copy the colrc_new.sql file as the colrc.sql file,
(c) go to the `disaster.sh` script and comment out the pg_dump.  Then run that script, then up the application again.  ffs.  

With the system down, `su` to `root`.  Navigate `/etc/letsencrypt`, and run this command:

```sudo certbot certonly```

You'll see a dialog that looks like this:

> How would you like to authenticate with the ACME CA?
> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
> 1: Nginx Web Server plugin (nginx)
> 2: Spin up a temporary webserver (standalone)
> 3: Place files in webroot directory (webroot)
> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
> Select the appropriate number [1-3] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel):  

Select option 2.

The certificate renewal should succeed, and Certbot will ask you for money.  Ignore that.

## Check that you have a new certificate.

Navigate to the subfolder called `live`, > `thecolrc.org`, then run `ls -la`. You'll see four 
files that have the extension .pem.  They should have the correct date.

You can also navigate back up one level and over to `archive`.  That folder contains the old and new `pem` files.

## Copy the new certificate into the correct directory

Navigate to the root of `/colrc-v2/certbot`.  Type `ls` and confirm that there is
a subdirectory `letsencrypt`.  While in the `certbot` directory, delete the directory and all its contents:

```rm -rf ./letsencrypt```

Then copy the newly refreshed directory into this place:

``` cp -R /etc/letsencrypt .```

Change the ownership of the letsencrypt directory in `certbot` to match your
user credentials:

``` chown -R [username]:[username] letsencrypt ```

## Build and up the app

To bring the system back up, execute the build script (making sure that the script is set to 
rebuild the images).

```./build.sh```  

Then keep your fingers and toes crossed that the system comes back up again.

When it reconstructs its mapped drive, it'll find the new (valid) certificate.

Navigate to the site from a browser at https://thecolrc.org and it (should) show that the site
is secured.

If it doesn't, um, contact Amy and John.  We'll cry and then see if we can fix it.

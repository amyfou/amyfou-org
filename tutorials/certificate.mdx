# Renewing our certificate

The production version of the colrc application runs with `https`, meaning that
all traffic to and from the app is encrypted.  This is a very important, and it
requires that we maintain a certificate verifying that our domain is registered to us 
and the URL we're running at is registered with that domain.

Every so often, that certificate requires renewal.   

For (waves hands in the air) reasons, we have not automated our certificate 
renewal process.  Yet.  Instead, we update the certificate manually.

## Renew the certificate

We use [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) as our certificate generator.

And we store our certificates in a directory that lives on our production server at the root of our project `./certbot`.
This folder is not included in our github repo, for obvious reasons (don't share your certificates folder, pls).

The `certbot` directory is ironically named because there's nothing `bot` about it.  But it contains a subdirectory called 
`letsencrypt`.  Navigate into that directory, and run this command:

```sudo certbot certonly```

You'll see a dialog that looks like this:

> How would you like to authenticate with the ACME CA?
> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
> 1: Spin up a temporary webserver (standalone)
> 2: Place files in webroot directory (webroot)
> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
> Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel):  

Select option 2.

## Check that you have a new certificate.

Navigate to the subfolder called `live`, > `thecolrc.org`, then run `ls -la`. You'll see four 
files that have the extension .pem.  They should have the correct date.

You can also navigate back up one level and over to `archive`.  That folder contains the old and new `pem` files.

If all's well, we're ready to go!

## Down and build/up the app

In our production environment, we use a shell script `disaster.sh` to bring the system down. 

Execute this script by navigating to the root of `colrc-v2` and typing:

```./disaster.sh```   

When prompted for the pwd, use the database password (not your sudo password).

To bring the system back up, execute the build script (making sure that the script is set to 
rebuild the images).

```./build.sh```  

Then keep your fingers and toes crossed that the system comes back up again.

When it reconstructs its mapped drive, it'll find the new (valid) certificate.

Navigate to the site from a browser at https://thecolrc.org and it (should) show that the site
is secured.

If it doesn't, um, contact Amy and John.  We'll cry and then see if we can fix it.

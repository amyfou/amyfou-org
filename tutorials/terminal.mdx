# Basic navigation in terminal

Most of us rarely use the terminal application to interact with our computers,
but in coding it's very useful to be able to do this.  Using the terminal application on
your machine is sometimes called using the `command line`, and many programs we
use come with both a graphical user interface (gui) and a command line interface (cli).

## Open a terminal window

This means go to your computer's terminal application.  On a windows
machine, we are talking about the regular `terminal` application, not PowerShell. This is 
important, because windows PowerShell has its own syntax and it operates on
weirdly different assumptions than a regular terminal application does.  Windows 10 and later
does have a `windows terminal` application, although in older versions it was called
the `command prompt` or `cmd` window.  We don't use that one either.

On windows, we use the Debian terminal.  Debian is a Linux system, so using
the terminal means you'll be using Linux commands.  On a Mac, the terminal 
application is just called `terminal`, and it uses Linux commands.

So to open a terminal, you can go to your apps or toolbar, find the correc
application (wsl Debian or terminal), and open it up.

## Working at the command line



When you open a terminal, you'll see a little string of characters on the left that 
typically include your username.  For example, I see this:

```amy@SBS-7719 ~ %```  

My username is `amy`, and I'm on a machine called `SBS-7719`.  The tilde tells me 
I'm at my home directory, and the `%` says that I'm at the beginning of a 
command line.

You can type `whomai` and the system will return your username, then give you a new
command prompt, like this:

    ```amy@SBS-7719 ~ % whoami```  
    ```amy```  
    ```amy@SBS-7719 ~ %```  

You can type `pwd` for "print working directory" and find out where you are 
in the local file system, then return you to the command prompt, like this:

    ```amy@SBS-7719 ~ % pwd```  
    ```/Users/amy```  
    ```amy@SBS-7719 ~ %```  

To see what files and directories are local to you, type `ls` or `ls -la`.  
The `ls` command just lists file and directory names, and does not include hidden files. The `ls -la` command gives 
you the filenames, permissions, sizes, etc for all files, including hidden ones.

    ```amy@SBS-7719 ~ % ls```    
    ```Desktop```  
    ```Downloads```  
    ``` [ etc ]```  
    ```src```  
    ```amy@SBS-7719 ~ %```  

To move into a directory on the list, use `cd ./[directoryname]`, like this:

    ```amy@SBS-7719 ~ % cd ./src```  
    ```amy@SBS-7719 src %```  
    ```amy@SBS-7719 ~ %``` 

Now that we're in the `src` directory, we can use `ls -la` and not see a billion files.

    ```amy@SBS-7719 src % ls -la```   
    ```total 16```   
    ```drwxr-xr-x   7 amy  staff   224 Feb 19 14:04 .```   
    ```drwxr-xr-x  20 amy  staff   640 Mar 11 13:47 .. ```   
    ```-rw-r--r--@  1 amy  staff  6148 Mar 11 14:02 .DS_Store ```   
    ```drwxr-xr-x   8 amy  staff   256 Feb 19 14:39 components ```   
    ```drwxr-xr-x  12 amy  staff   384 Mar 11 13:04 images```   
    ```drwxr-xr-x   9 amy  staff   288 Feb 24 13:34 pages```   
    ```drwxr-xr-x   3 amy  staff    96 Feb 18 17:38 templates```   

in the above, we get list of file permissions, the number of files in each directory,
the user who owns the directory, the group of that user, the size of the directory, an
edited on date and the name of the directory.  Any directory name that begins with `.`
is a hidden directory that you would not see if you used `ls` instead of `ls -la`.

Here are more handy commands:
- To move up one level, use `cd ..`.  To move up two levels, `cd ..\..`, and so forth.
- To make a new directory, use `mkdir [directoryname]`
- To make a new textfile, use `touch [filename]`
- To open your VS code editor from wherever you are, use `code .`
- To open a file with nano, use `nano [filename]`
- To delete a file, use `rm [filename]`
- To delete a directory and everything in it use `rm -rf [directoryname]`
- To copy a file from another location to where you are, use `cp [filepath\sourcefile] .`
- To copy a file from where you are to another location, use `cp [filename] [filepath\filename]`

# Working remotely in an ssh session

## Connecting to a remote machine via ssh

To connect to a remote server, use `ssh [username]@[serverURL]`. 
For example, when I log into our ms azure vm, I type `ssh avf@0.171.0.206`.
When you get there, you'll either have to authenticate with a pwd or an ssh key.
After successfully authenticating, you'll get a command prompt and you'll be able
to use all the commands listed here (except `code .`)

Note that in order to run docker on a machine you must have `sudo` ("superuser do") access
to that machine.  If you attempt to run a command on a remote machine and it
doesn't work, try again with `sudo` and a space before the command.

### Using your VSCode as a texteditor on a remote machine

In your local VSCode, find and install the 'Remote ssh` extension.  

Open VS Code locally, and select `View` --> `Command Pallette` --> `Remote SSH:connect to host`.

You'll be prompted to log in to the remote machine using the ssh command above.  
Once you're authenticated, you can open a directory on the remote machine using the `File` --> `Open Folder` command.

### Pulling up a browser with the dev environment on a remote machine

Use the remote machine's URL instead of `localhost`.  For example, point a
browser to 0.171.0.206:3000 if you're developing on the ms azure vm at that URL.

### Leaving your SSH session

When you're done working in a remote ssh session, end any processes
that were running on the machine you logged into.  Bring down the dev 
environment for example, by typing

```sudo docker compose down```  

Once everything's safely shut down, type `exit` to leave the session.

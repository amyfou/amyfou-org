# How to write PSQL commands against our database from inside of Docker:

## First access the console for the running psql container: colrc-v2-postgres-db 

Up the development environment and access the Docker Desktop application.

Find colrc-v2-postgres-db.

At the far right of each running image is a set of three vertical dots. Click there and the system will open a terminal inside the container.

This is what you should see:

`#`

This is the psql command line.  

## Login to the colrc database

To login to the db, type:

``# psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d colrc -U postgres --password``

You will be prompted for a password.  You can get the password from Amy or John or Alice or anyone else on the team whose done this process. 

On successful login you should see this:

``psql (12.12 (Debian 12.12-1.pgdg110+1))``
``Type "help" for help.``

You can now run psql commands at the command line.  

## Run some fun commands

### View and Describe Tables

To see all of the tables in the database: `\dt;`
To see the description of a table:  `\d+ [table_name];`

### Count things

You may need to create aggregate queries that count the number of rows matching a certain set of criteria.

To count the number of records in a single table: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [table_name];`

### View data in one table

You can view all the entries in one or more columns in a single table with `SELECT [column_name] FROM [table_name];`
Or `SELECT [column_name1], [column_name2] FROM [table_name];`

### Get fancy by joining tables

You can select data from two or more tables that are connected with a primary/foreign key relation, and display the data in one chart.  For example:

First try this:

`SELECT category, english, salish FROM stems` 

and your query will return data that look like this:

| category | english | salish |  
| - | - | - | 
| 1 | go out, singular and plural | acqaʔ |  
| 2 | look at                     | ac'x̣  |  


etc.  

The '1' is a foreign key to the table called stem_categories, and that table translates the 1 (and 2, and 3) from stems.category into values like 'noun', 'verb' and 'other'.

When you run a query that returns lots of rows, you can click the space bar to advance through all the rows, or `q` to get out of the table and return to the command line prompt.

You can running the following command to translate that '1' into its value from the stem_categories table.

`SELECT value, english, salish FROM stems LEFT JOIN stem_categories ON stems.category=stem_categories.id`

now you'll see this:

| category | english | salish |  
| - | - | - | 
| verbs | go out, singular and plural | acqaʔ |  
| verbs | look at                     | ac'x̣  |  

etc.

In addition to joining tables, you can order the results with an ORDER BY clause:

`SELECT value, english, salish FROM stems LEFT JOIN stem_categories ON stems.category=stem_categories.id order by value, english;`

This will return results ordered first by 'value' (alphabetically, so 'nouns' will all appear first), and then by the English translation.

And you can filter the results so that you only return rows that match some criterion you state:

`SELECT value, english, salish FROM stems LEFT JOIN stem_categories ON stems.category=stem_categories.id WHERE english like '%horse%' order by value, english;`

The above command should return this:


| value |                 english                  |   salish    |  
| - | - | - |   
| nouns | horse collar, necklace                   | s-q'ɛl'-ɛps |  
| nouns | horse, pet, domestic animal              | ɛsčíčɛʔ     |  
| verbs | be black (of horses)                     | q'ʷəd(u-)   |  
| verbs | be well-shaped (as workhorse)            | mɛč'        |  
| verbs | dive from land (face in horseshoe curve) | us-əlš      |  
| verbs | gray (as horse)                          | x̣iy   |    

(6 rows)

Note that percent sign is a wildcard characater that matches any number of characters in its position.  If we don't use the "%", we try:

`SELECT value, english, salish FROM stems LEFT JOIN stem_categories ON stems.category=stem_categories.id WHERE english like 'horse' order by value, english;`

and get no results at all because there are no English translations that contain ONLY the string 'horse'.


| value | english | salish |  
| - | - | - | 
| | | |

(0 rows)

If we put the wildcard on the right of the string, like this:

`SELECT value, english, salish FROM stems LEFT JOIN stem_categories ON stems.category=stem_categories.id WHERE english like 'horse%' order by value, english;`

We get results in which the English translation begins with 'horse...'

 |value |           english           |   salish    | 
 | - | - | - |  
 | nouns | horse collar, necklace      | s-q'ɛl'-ɛps |  
 | nouns | horse, pet, domestic animal | ɛsčíčɛʔ     |  

(2 rows)

We can even combine counting/aggregate queries with all of this and count the number of entries in different categories that meet our criteria:
                                                               
`SELECT value, COUNT(*) FROM stems LEFT JOIN stem_categories ON stems.category=stem_categories.id WHERE english like '%horse%' GROUP BY stem_categories.value;`

Should return this:

| value | count |  
| - | - |
| verbs |     4 |  
| nouns |     2 |  

(2 rows)
